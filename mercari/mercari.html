		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> My UI goals were to <span class = "projectbold"> declutter </span> information, make it <span class = "projectbold"> easy to scan sections</span>, make all call-to-action's <span class = "projectbold">reachable with the thumb</span>, and make the app feel like a <span class = "projectbold">lively marketplace.</span> 
		</div>
	<div class = "separator">
	</div>
		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> <span class = "projectboldheader">Decluttered & Scannable </span>
		<br>
		To do this, I gave section titles the breathing space of 75% of the title font height. I also avoided white sections against gray backgrounds because the <span class = "projectbold"> gray space takes up more space</span>, and used clean lines to indicate breaks. 
		</div>
		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'>
		To allow for scanning sections, I used 2 formats- consistent bolding and larger font sizes for titles and regular font for content. 
		</div>
		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'>
		One section upon scrolling down was also purposely left collasped, so that users could click on it, and discover that all sections are collapsable. 
		</div>
		<br>	
		<br>
		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> <span class = "projectboldheader">Element Placement </span>
		<br>	
		<span class = "projectbold"> All actionables can be reached with the thumb </span> without needing to let go of the bottom of the phone. 
		</div>
		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'>
		Traditionally placed in the top corner of many other apps, the favorites button is now moved below the picture to be easily reached. 
		</div>
		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'>
		The product picture roughly half the size of the screen so users can reach the bottom of the image and swipe through product pictures with one hand.
		</div>
		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'>
		The purchase button is closest to the thumb, and floats there with the fixed position footer. 
		</div>
		<br>	
		<br>
		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> <span class = "projectboldheader">Colors </span>
		<br>	
		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'>
		To minimize distractions from the CTA's, but also be able to highlight links, I choose two colors- <span class = "projectbold"> a friendly red, and a cool purple. </span> 
		</div>
		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'>
		I wanted a <span class = "projectbold">lively color that made the marketplace feel energized. </span> The stimulating red that colors the two main CTA's is then balanced with the cool purple, which also happens to be the favorite color of adolescent females.

		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> <span class = "projectbold">Good design is a good conversation. </span></div>
		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'>
		Bad designs talk over their users- bombarding users with info, features, and colors that users aren’t asking for. </div>
	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'>	<span class = "projectbold"> I want to strive to create digital experiences that feel alive,</span> able to respond to the things users are indicating, and keep other information and features silent until the conversation veers off in that direction.
