<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
I was just thinking about how things move really fast nowadays. 
</div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
There was a time, back in elementary school, when things did not move fast. Car rides were an eternity, and so was that social studies class before math, when I got to sit next to my crush. 
</div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
Today, <br>weeks fly.
</div>


<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
Pause. You might be confused right now. What is this, you ask? And where’s the magic? Right. I hate clickbait too. </div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
This is an open book- a space where stray thoughts are given a home. These thoughts are about you, me, and time. 
</div>


<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
About me, I make stuff people see on screens, floating in hands and illuminating faces with blueish light.
</div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
About time, the screens have made time move faster. So fast that I wonder if what’s human and real can get whisked away. 
</div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
About you, I wonder if you’re a recruiter, viewing this on a screen in the office. Or maybe a friend of mine, or an acquaintance, or someone I’ve never met. I wonder if you’re also a designer. 
</div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
Whoever you are, I have a question for you:
</div>


<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
Did you ever do things like stare at a pencil and try to move it telepathically when you were younger? Think that maybe deep down you’ve got super powers? 
</div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
Sometimes, I still sort of do that.
</div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
On nights when life hunts me down with deadlines and other life-things, I’d close my eyes, and telepathically try to stop time.  
</div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
(Spoiler alert, I’m not telepathic.)
</div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
But I do wonder if I could make a space that turns off white noise for you, just for a second, the way good books do. The way pages are the wind past a cliff, capable of swallowing you, me, and time. 
</div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
Between you and me, here’s some honesty. I’m lost. The roaring twenties have swept the feet out first, drowned the air, and proved that icy wave after wave wait for nothing. 
</div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
Why am I telling you this? I’m quite a private person. You’ve got the right to doubt me because you’ve found my open book in a corner of the Internet.
</div> 

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
Well, there’s something fascinating about raw transparency. It creates moments that sting, comfort, and maybe even stop time. 
</div>

<div class = 'p2' id = 'spacing'>
Maybe we did that here.
</div>
