	First, because of the large load of <span class = "projectbold">administrative work</span>, teachers lack the time to incorporate creative curriculum into their lecture.

	<ul class = "p" id = "spacing">
	<li>
	2nd - 3rd grade students are generally quiet individuals who don’t have opportunities to speak up in class. </li>
	<li> Students are good listeners. They will retain what others say and build off of existing conversation. </li>
	<li> Students will avoid fixating on things already said and will come up with original ideas each time a new student speaks. </li>
	<li> Students will let other students speak and wait their turn before adding to the discussion. </li>
	<li> It is the student’s natural inclination to want to obey authority- and they need to learn how to challenge authority instead. </li>
	<li> The students will focus on the task at hand in group activities. </li>
	</ul>
	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> In my 2nd – 3rd grade classroom, order, authority, and focus are a few of the most important things that students learn. Students normally just want to verbalize whatever is on their mind and do whatever they want when given the chance. I personally did not speak up in class in elementary school. But I was not the end user. This class may have its own personality compared to other classes, but these characteristics made it difficult to play the game UNLESS the class was led by a strong teacher who was able to assert authority and moderate discussion. </div>
	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> Observations: </div>
	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> This was a very chaotic game. Students got way too excited by the game, and it made them want to get out of their seats and start enacting different characteristic traits.  </div>
	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> Getting students excited but also focused is another issue. Though students say interesting things diverging off topic, productive creativity needs structure and focus.  </div>
