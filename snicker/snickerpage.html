	<span class = "projectboldheader">FINDINGS</span>


	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	In synthesizing key quotes, sentiments, and pain points that we spoke to people about, we found two main blockades to creativity in the classroom. </div>
		<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 

	First, because of the large load of <span class = "projectbold">administrative work</span>, teachers lack the time to incorporate creative curriculum into their lecture. Secondly, high-energy elementary school students need <span class = "projectbold">an environment of structured chaos</span> to practice creativity.

	How might we energize students while maintaining their focus during creative exercises?  </div>

	<div class = "separator" id = "top">
	</div>

	<span class = "projectboldheader">DESIGN PRINCIPALS</span>
	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	Translating our insights into a solution, we decided on five points we wanted our product to accomplish. </div>

	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	First, with the goal being to enhance creativity in 2nd graders, our priority was that to <span class = "projectbold">foster divergent thinking by facilitating open-ended discussion.</span> </div>
<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	Second, because speaking out about ambiguous answers requires risk-taking, we found that students were more likely to think divergently when they felt that their voices were valued. Therefore, we wanted to make students' knowledge from outside a classroom valuable, by making our activity <span class = "projectbold">require students to draw from formal and informally learned knowledge.</span>  </div>
<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	Third, we knew that each classroom was different. Each group of students have different needs, and the focus of the teachers could be different. We wanted our activity to adapt to specific classroom needs by <span class = "projectbold">offering multiple ways to interact with the exercise.</span> </div>
<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	Fourth, we wanted to help <span class = "projectbold">develop empathy</span> in students by asking them to imagine a day in someone else's life. </div>
<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> 
	Lastly, we wanted to ensure that the activity could be easily implemented into the school day by giving teachers <span class = "projectbold">easy control of how long the activity would last.</span></div>

<br>
<br>
<br>
	<span class = "projectboldheader">IDEATION</span>
	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> From these design principals, we came up with 15+ activities that hit all of our design principals and landed on something that could most seamlessly and effortlessly be integrated with the teacherâ€™s existing curriculum: Snickerdoodle. </div>

	<span class = "projectboldheader">USER TESTING</span>

	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> We tested our product in a fourth grade classroom during afterschool hours.</div>
	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> During our user testing, we uncovered more problems and assumptions that we had about the way the game would work and the way classroom interactions work. </div>
	<BR>
	<br>
	<span class = "projectboldheader">OUR ASSUMPTIONS</span>

	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> We thought that elementary school students were generally quiet individuals who didn't have enough opportunities to speak up in class. For the most part, students were bouncing off the walls and <span class = "projectbold">speaking over each other.</span> </div>
	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> Our game also worked if students were good listeners who retain what others say and build off of existing conversation. This is not a natural tendency, and <span class = "projectbold">students are usually just waiting their turn to speak.</span> They also fixate on things already said and just come up with minor variations of contributed thoughts.</div>
	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> We also assumed that it was the student's natural inclination to want to obey authority- and they need to learn how to challenge authority instead. However, <span class = "projectbold">students often test their teachers.</span></div>
	<BR>
	<br>
	<span class = "projectboldheader">UX TESTING INSIGHTS</span>

	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> In the 4th classroom, <span class = "projectbold">order, authority, and focus are a few of the most important things that students learn.</span> This class may have its own personality compared to other classes, but these characteristics made it difficult to play the game UNLESS the class was led by a strong teacher who was able to assert authority and moderate discussion. </div>

	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> The game energized students and they had fun, but we needed to get students focused as well. Though students say interesting things diverging off topic, productive creativity needs structure and focus.  </div>

	<div class = "p" id = "spacing"> In future iterations, I would consider including a way to reward active listening and building discussion off of previous comments. We could also test penalizing any repeated comments. </div>
