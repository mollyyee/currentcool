	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> Grove is a green eCommerce service that sells natural home products in recurring, editable shipments. In addition to the recurring shipments, Grove also offers a premium VIP membership with an annual fee, which includes perks like unlimited free shipping & returns, price matching, and gifts. </div>

	<br>
	<br>
	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
A cancellation flow is a great opportunity to engage with customers. A friendly cancellation flow should listen to user’s needs and provide relevant solutions. After all, it's possible to solve customers' needs without them cancelling.  </div>
	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 

Our current cancellation flow requires users to email our customer service, so that our customer service team would have the opportunity to listen to the needs of the customers and then offer alternative solutions from cancelling. 
</div>
	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 

This method not only generates large amounts of ticket volume, but also can infuriate customers and feel forceful, which reduced our chances of retaining a customer after premium VIP membership cancellation.

	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	<span class = "projectboldheader">UX RESEARCH</span>
	<br>
	<br>

	Conducting UX surveys with 40 customers and interviews with 5 customers, my team and I found that <span class = "projectbold"> customers had trouble differentiating between 3 types of cancellation</span>:
</div>
	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 

1. VIP Membership Cancellation (Premium account) <br>
2. Recurring Shipment Cancellation (Auto Ship account) <br>
3. Grove Account (Any type of shipment account) 
</div>
	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	Two things automatically begin for users once they become customers- recurring product shipments and the VIP premium trial. Because these two automatic features start at the same time, users confuse them for each other. It is difficult to distinguish that VIP membership is not the recurring product shipments. 
</div>



	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	After more in-depth research of our current flow, we found that we were funneling users with 3 different cancellation issues into one VIP-Cancellation UX flow. This doesn't address users' problems in a targeted way.

	<p> Examination of the experience of users learning about VIP.  </p>
	<br>


	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 

Our problem for VIP membership cancellation through the digital platform is 2-tiered. First, users lack information. They do not clearly understand the VIP program solely through the digital platform. Second, we create a lot of UX friction for VIP membership cancellation- having to write an email to cancel membership is a lot of work and may deter or anger customers. 

</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<img class = "full" src = "./assets/vipscreen.png">
<p> Our current website only provides limited information about VIP, relying heavily on emails and our customer service team to explain VIP to customers. Our relevant screen does not explain the program, the perks, or allow users to cancel.

</p>

<br>
<Br>


	<span class = "projectboldheader">COMPETITIVE RESEARCH</span>

	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
Following the analysis of our current flow, I conducted a comprehensive review of cancellation flows on numerous eCommerce sites.
	</div>
<br>
	<img class = "full" src = "./assets/birchbox.png">
	<p> Birchbox practices: surveying users about why they're cancelling and make it a necessary field to fill out before users can successfully cancel. There's also an option to "change subscription" before clicking on "cancel subscription."  </p>

	<br>

	<br>
	<img class = "full" src = "./assets/thrive.png">
	<p> Thrive provides an additional promotional offer that adds value for customers. Their cancellation flow also includes 3 extra screens asking users if they are sure that they want to cancel. </p>

	<br>
	<br>

	<img class = "full" src = "./assets/amazon.png">
	<p> Amazon pitches the value of their prime membership during the cancellation flow. They also offer an alternative and cheaper membership program. </p>

	<span class = "projectboldheader">FINDINGS</span>


	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
The resulting takeaways from the competitive research and UX research are the following:
</div>
	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 

1. <span class = "projectbold">Listen to users:</span> each user comes to cancel “VIP” with a different problem in mind. By better assessing what their pain points are for us, we can better provide relevant solutions instead of “cancellation Grove membership” altogether for them. <br>
2. <span class = "projectbold">Provide relevant information:</span> better communicating the value of Grove accounts, auto ship accounts, and VIP membership. <br>
3. <span class = "projectbold">Offer alternative solutions:</span> not all users really want to cancel VIP. It’s our job to show them how much they’re saving or the value of our program for them. By transparently communicating our value and their pain points, we can help build trust between us and our users.

	<div class = "separator" id = "top">
	</div>

	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	In a random sample of 40 customers who churned after 2nd shipment, 47.5% of customers want to cancel their Grove accounts because of the automatic nature of Grove’s service (including auto VIP renewals and auto-shipments.)
	</div>

	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	There are a myriad of reasons, like missing shipments, bad customer service, and the auto-shipment service, that make users want to cancel with Grove. By recognizing that these factors make users want to cancel their premium membership, incorporating these pain points into the cancellation flow and providing relevant solutions to each pain point can improve the user's experience and keep the doors at Grove open. </div>
