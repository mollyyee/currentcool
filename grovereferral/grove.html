	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> Grove is a green eCommerce service that sells natural home products in recurring, editable shipments.</div>
	<div class = "p" id = "spacing">
	I was tasked with redesigning a referral flow that required users to share on their Facebook wall and send a link through Facebook Messenger in order to get a gift that shipped with their next shipment.

	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	The design goal was to make the referral flow behave exactly as users expect.

	</div>
	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	Users were used to only needing to complete one type of sharing on social media from other companies' referral experiences. Given that we were requiring something different, we had to be extra clear that they had to complete two steps and always feel there was a clear call to action on the page.

	The number of people who completed the referral flow requiring two steps increased by at least 400%, and the number of people who visit the page from referrals increased by 59%.

	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
	Data-informed design is tricky. Submitting design decisions to data is just step 1 of the process. Using correctly interpreted data is step 2. 
	</div>

	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
Quantitative data is not more important than qualitative data, and vice versa. The misconception I faced was that qualitative data is subjective, and the bigger the sample size the better. 
	</div>

	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
This process has shown me that both qualitative and quantitative data if interpreted without each other end up producing subjective insights. Isolated data (meaning one or the other) could always be interpreted in many ways. The most objective insights are found when qualitative and quantitative data are used to interpret each other. 
	</div>
	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 
(Also, customer service knows everything. That awesome team was my first stop, go-to for investigating usability issues.)

Set design KPI’s and design principals for myself. Being one of two designers at a startup made it easy for it to lose sight of what success looked like for a designer. </div>

	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 

First, I wanted my interdepartmental team to succeed and help all stakeholders to hit their required business goals. But then I started getting into the mindset that my designs were successful only if a conversion chart skyrocketed. </div>

	<div class = 'p' id = 'spacing'> 

Though that may be true for the team, as a designer, there are other indicators that measure success that may not be correlated with sky-rocketing conversion. I cared about increasing trust, transparency, and clarity between the customer and our platform. Though these factors are more difficult to measure, especially as short term impact, it was important for me to set these goals for each project so that I had my clear-cut perspective to bring to the table. </div>
